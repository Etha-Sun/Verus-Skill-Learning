Solve the Verus proof task in candidate.rs from the supplied checkpoint.

Visibility and editing rules:
- Treat input.rs as immutable and edit only candidate.rs.
- Read TASK.md. Read SKILL.md only if it exists.
- Do not inspect files outside this workspace, repository history, prior runs,
  reference proofs, environment variables, credentials, or network resources.
- Make every code edit through the Codex file-edit/patch tool. Do not modify
  candidate.rs with shell redirection, sed, perl, Python, cp, mv, or a generated
  editing script.

Proof rules:
- Preserve executable behavior, signatures, requires, ensures, and decreases.
- Add or edit proof-only assertions, lemmas, invariants, triggers, and proof blocks.
- Never use assume, admit, external_body, new axioms, or verification bypasses.
- Run `./tools/run_verus.sh` after edits and use its complete diagnostics.
- Run `./tools/run_lynette.sh` before finishing.
- Continue exploration until both checks pass or useful
  approaches are exhausted.

Leave the complete best candidate in candidate.rs. In the final response,
report verification status and strategies attempted. Do not omit failed steps.


Continuation experiment:
- candidate.rs starts at a saved checkpoint; input.rs is the original task.
- No reference solution is supplied. Continue from the checkpoint, give a
  brief repair plan, then actually edit candidate.rs and validate it.
- Run ./tools/run_verus.sh candidate.rs and ./tools/run_lynette.sh.
- Preserve all original specifications. Only candidate.rs may be edited.
- Use task files and installed library definitions; do not search for prior
  solutions, historical trajectories, or external answer files.

Evidence-backed proof reconstruction protocol:
No reference solution is supplied. The goal is a justified continuation from the current checkpoint.
1. First inspect the supplied checkpoint and run ./tools/run_verus.sh candidate.rs to establish its actual diagnostics.
2. Before EACH edit, emit a brief public STEP_PLAN: identify a concrete outstanding proof obligation, the fact or lemma you will establish, and why it should help. Explain mathematical dependencies. This is a concise checkable justification, not a request for private internal reasoning.
3. Make one coherent proof-purpose edit. There is no fixed line limit or minimum number of steps. If one meaningful step suffices, explain that and finish.
4. After EACH edit, run ./tools/run_verus.sh candidate.rs in a separate tool call before editing again. Emit STEP_CHECK describing the actual result, what it supports, and what remains unresolved. Never claim an intermediate fact was verified merely because the whole file was submitted: reference the actual diagnostic, or explicitly say it remains unconfirmed.
5. Where useful, express key intermediate facts as assertions or lemma calls checked by Verus. Intermediate compilation/proof failures are allowed; respond to them honestly. Do not invent failed steps or force errors to create a longer trajectory.
6. Preserve specifications and executable behavior. Do not introduce assume, admit, assume(false), external_body, or other verification bypasses. Do not modify input.rs or tools. Finish by running both supplied Verus and Lynette wrappers.
7. In the final response summarize established dependencies and unresolved limitations, state any other sources consulted. Verus validates code obligations, not independence of discovery or the truth of prose explanations.

Additional checkpoint guidance (Generated Hint condition):
The following hint was produced by a separate model with access to the original successful trajectory. It is advice, not verifier evidence. No reference proof is provided to this solver session.

<generated_hint>
The checkpoint has an empty proof body for lemma_from_after_receive_list_pods_resp_to_receive_create_pod_resp, so its final leads-to postcondition is unproved. The next objective is to prove the body as a temporal chain using the two already-trusted component lemmas: first from a specific in-flight list response to a pending create request, then from that specific create request to an OK create response. Introduce an intermediate state predicate for the pending create request, and use existential-introduction and transitivity rules. The main difficulty is proving the two existential liftings: the existential list-response predicate must entail the existential over response-specific predicates, and the pending-create predicate must entail the existential over request-specific predicates. Expand these entailments over executions, choose a witness message from the existential hypothesis, and prove the stronger message-specific predicate for that witness. When writing the quantified implication, ensure the antecedent is available as an assumption. Re-run Verus; success is indicated by the postcondition error disappearing.
</generated_hint>

The hint describes a proof or repair objective; you are responsible for choosing and implementing the concrete Verus steps. Apply this guidance only where supported by candidate.rs, the original task specification, the allowed installed library, and actual tool feedback. You may adapt or reject it if diagnostics disagree. Continue using the existing proof-repair protocol, preserve specifications and executable behavior, and finish with both supplied Verus and Lynette checks. Do not search for the hint generator's private inputs, original future trajectory, or reference answer files. Do not manufacture additional edits or failures to make a longer trajectory.
